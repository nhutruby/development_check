{:id => '7', :name => 'Know More - General', :permalink => 'know_more', :content => "*What is iTourSmart?*

At the core of itoursmart.com lives:
* A highly-searchable directory of Tour Operators, Travel Suppliers, and Destination Marketing Organizations
* A simple internal member-to-member messaging system
* A networking engine which allows you to connect to the people with whom you do business (or desire to do business)
<br/>

*How will this help me?*

While there is no substitute for the personal relationships created and cultivated through face-to-face contact, there has not been a great vehicle for buyers and sellers to communicate changes and needs throughout the year.

On one hand, we have the far too familiar *'URGENT - UPDATED PRICING'* email blast, sent to every @living.body known to mankind in hopes that it will be read by the right person.  On the other, we have the continuous stream of calls/emails from tour operators, looking to gather information and pricing - today (right this second) - from a new supplier whose primary contact has changed.
<br/>
*Enter - iTourSmart*
By providing a resource that is not limited to members of a given association or niche, iTourSmart provides an efficient and effective space for buyers and sellers to identify and connect with one another.
<br/>
*What do I get for 'free'?*
All members are able to utilize the core services listed at the top of this page.  Without spending a penny you can claim/create/manage your business profile to ensure that potential clients are accessing accurate information.
<br/>
*What am I going to have to pay for?*
If you are a Tour Operator, Trade Association, or Destination Marketing Organization - nothing!
<br/>
For those that desire to market or products/services to iTourSmart members, selecting one of our paid plans may be a worthwhile investment.  As a paid account, your company will be able to share detailed product information and pricing, your directory listing will be enhanced and prioritized, and you will be able to manage multiple users per company to ensure that your entire team is in the game.
<br/>
We want you to be 100% satisfied with value you recieve, so please feel free to try an upgraded account for 30 days before we ask you to pay (no credit card needed).
<br/>
*How do I signup?*
To ensure that iTourSmart remains a tool for travel professionals, you must be invited to join.  There are a few ways to secure your invitation:
* Contact a colleague that is a member and ask him/her to send you an invitation
* Click the 'support' link on the menu bar and provide our team with some information about your business so that we can do our due diligence.  FYI - we are pretty quick, so this won't take long!"},

<br />
*We Believe:*
  * *Running a business is hard enough.*  You shouldn't have to spend countless hours creating, maintaining and updating contact and product information.  The average tour operator works with dozens of suppliers every day.  Given the constantly changing industry, keeping tabs on even your top 20 suppliers is difficult enough.  iTourSmart makes it easy!  
  * *Maintaining accurate supplier information should be simple.*  With just a few simple clicks, you can find detailed product and contact information for thousands of suppliers.
  * *Spend time making money, not maintaining your database.*  Most tour operators spend weeks and countless hours manually calling and updating product information with suppliers.  This process relies  on staff to accurately replicate information and costs companies loads of cash.  iTourSmart saves you time, money and best of all, gives you the accurate and reliable data you need to run your business.
  * *Find what you need when you need it.*  Your staff should be spending time with customers not searching for suppliers.  With iTourSmart, you have immediate access to product information that  is updated daily by suppliers.  Your team is entitled to have the tools necessary to deliver the best experience to your customers.
<br />

*iTourSmart Credo*

iTourSmart will deliver fast and simple solutions that will:
 * Save you money
 * Connect to accurate and reliable supplier information
 * Be available 24/7 from anywhere on any internet accessible device
